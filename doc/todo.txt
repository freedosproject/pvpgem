THINGS I'D LIKE TO ADD/FIX IN FUTURE VERSIONS:

+ Don't redraw the entire board every time. Probably one way around
  this is to update show_board to take an extra option:
  
  void show_board(int **board, int bgcolor);
  
  ..and for any value 0-15, use that for the background color. For any
  value outside that range, don't draw the background at all (just draw
  gems on top of what you already have).

+ Let the user add their own names, not "Player 0" and "Player 1."

+ Replace numerical score with a "progress bar" to visually show the
  "race" to the finish line.

+ Instead of plain circles, make them actual gems using different
  shapes (diamons, etc). Probably easiest to do this by drawing a gem
  at startup, saving that with _getimage, then using _putimage to
  stamp it onto the screen.
