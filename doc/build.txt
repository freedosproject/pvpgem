HOW TO BUILD:

PvP Gem leverages the graphics primitives functions from OpenWatcom,
so you will need OpenWatcom to build this on FreeDOS.

There are no libraries or other dependencies.

Set up your OpenWatcom environment as you usually would. For example,
the FreeDOS distribution includes an OWSETUP.BAT that sets up your
environment variables so you can compile with OpenWatcom.

The BUILD.BAT includes all the steps to compile PvP Gem.
