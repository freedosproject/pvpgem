ABOUT THE GAME:

PvP Gem is a two-player match-3 game. There are 8 different gems on a
10x10 board.

Two players take turns. You select a "gem," that gem is destroyed, and
you get a point. Other gems fill in from above. If you can match 3 or
more gems, you get points for those too. The first player to reach 25
points wins the game.


HOW TO PLAY:

For your turn, use the arrow keys to move the selector frame around
the board. When you have found the gem you want to destroy, press the
Enter key to select it.

That gem will be destroyed, and you'll get a point. Other gems will
fill in from above. If the result is a match of 3 or more gems of the
same color, those are destroyed and you get more points. And so on for
further matches.

Then your turn is over and it's your opponent's turn.

Playing PvP Gem requiers some strategy. As you play, you need to be
careful what gem you destroy so you don't set up your opponent for a
great move!
