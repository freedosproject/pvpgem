# pvpgem
A two-player match-3 game for DOS

In this game, two players take turns. You select a "gem," that gem is
destroyed, and you get a point. Other gems fill in from above. If you
can match 3 or more gems, you get points for those too. The first player to
reach 25 points wins the game.

As you play, you need to be careful what gem you destroy, so you don't set up
your opponent for a great move!

Here are two screenshots, showing player "0" (left-side player) about to take a turn. The selector
frame is over a yellow gem. When that gets destroyed, the cyan gem falls down and matches 3
gems.

But notice that now player "1" (right-side player) can also destroy a different yellow gem (highlighted) to
then match 3 red gems.

So this is more than a simple match-3 Bejeweled clone. PvP Gem requires some strategy, too. As you
play, you need to be careful what gem you destroy so you don't set up your opponent for a great
move!
